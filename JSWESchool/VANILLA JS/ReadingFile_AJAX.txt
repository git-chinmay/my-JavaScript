AJAX Examples
XMLHttpRequest is a built-in browser object that allows to make HTTP requests in JavaScript.

Despite of having the word “XML” in its name, it can operate on any data, not only in XML format. We can upload/download files, track progress and much more.

Right now, there’s another, more modern method fetch, that somewhat deprecates XMLHttpRequest.

In modern web-development XMLHttpRequest is used for three reasons:

Historical reasons: we need to support existing scripts with XMLHttpRequest.
We need to support old browsers, and don’t want polyfills (e.g. to keep scripts tiny).
We need something that fetch can’t do yet, e.g. to track upload progress.
Does that sound familiar? If yes, then all right, go on with XMLHttpRequest. Otherwise, please head on to Fetch.
