<!--BROWSER OBJECT MODEL
All global JS objects,functions,variables are memebr of the windows object.Windows object belongs to Browser.
The DOM is also belongs to BOM
document.getElementById("header") is same as window.document.getElementById("header");



<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<p id="demo"></p>
<p id="s"></p>
<p id="navi"></p>

<h2>The Navigator Object</h2>
<p>The appName property returns the application name of the browser:</p>
<p id="nav"></p>
<p>Strange enough, "Netscape" is the application name for both IE11, Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.</p>

<script>
var w = window.innerWidth
var h = window.innerHeight
var sw = screen.width
var sh = screen.height

var x = document.getElementById("demo");
x.innerHTML = "Browser inner window width: " + w + "pixels, height: " + h + "pixels.";

var x = document.getElementById("s");
x.innerHTML = "Browser screen width: " + sw + "pixels, height: " + sh + "pixels.";

var y = window.navigator.appName;
document.getElementById("nav").innerHTML = y;
</script>

</body>
</html>-->

<!--JS COOKIES

Cookies are data, stored in small text files, on your computer.
When a web server has sent a web page to a browser, the connection is shut down, 
and the server forgets everything about the user.

Cookies were invented to solve the problem "how to remember information about the user":

When a user visits a web page, his/her name can be stored in a cookie.
Next time the user visits the page, the cookie "remembers" his/her name.
Cookies are saved in name-value pairs like: username = John Wick

When a browser requests a web page from a server, cookies belonging to the page are added to the request. This way the server gets the necessary data to "remember" information about users.
JavaScript can create, read, and delete cookies with the document.cookie property.

create: document.cookie =  "username=John Wick";
withy expiry: document.cookie = "username=John Wick; expires=Thu, 18 Dec 2019 12:00:00 UTC";

Read: var x = document.cookie;
document.cookie will return all cookies in one string much like: cookie1=value; cookie2=value; cookie3=value;
